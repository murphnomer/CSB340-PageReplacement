# CSB340-PageReplacement

## Results
OPT did the best, then LRU, followed by FIFO.

## Comparison
As expected, the OPT algorithm produces the fewest page faults in every case, as this is by definition.  However, the LRU algorithm is very close in performance, and is drastically simpler to operate and far more efficient programmatically.
